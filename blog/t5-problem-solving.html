      <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you.  1. Got blocked on a simple problem.  2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
        <ul><li>The Problem was to solve how many instance of "B" were in a string in uppercase</li></ul>
        <ul><li>Main problem solving technique I used was pseudocode, which I find is an effective way of simplifying a problem into something simple. I also google searched which is always useful because other devs have had this problem in the past.
        <ul><li>Throughtout the process I felt ok, I'm still new to pseudocode so will develop over time.  I'm pretty adept at Google searches too, as long as I've tried to actually have a decent attempt at the answer</li></ul>
        <ul><li>I learnt of the importance to not get overwhelmed by a problem and learn to not get entangled in technical syntax initially because that intimidates you.  Best to learn to break down a problem into small chunks first.</li></ul>
      <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h2>
      <ul><li>Pseudocode: Still fairly new to it, need to practise more so I guess am beginner status but its fairly intuitive anyway. Console logging to check if code works as intended is imperative</li></ul>
      </li><ul>reading error messages: still bit intimidating as dont understand most output, so gotta get used to scanning for important info only</li></ul>
       </li><ul>console logging: fairly confident with using it and why to test code </li></ul>
        </li><ul>googling: confident as grew up doing this</li></ul>
        </li><ul>asking peers for  help: mostly confident, although at times do feel selfconscious if do all the time</li></ul>
        </li><ul>asking coaches for help: ok with this although don't like to ask too often without first trying myself</li></ul>
        </li><ul>Improving your process with reflection:: i do reflection as part of exercises but not as active as i could on my own initiative</li></ul>

    <h2>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h2>
    <ul><li>Array.map() - The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Array.filter() - The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function..</li></ul>
      <ul><li>Array.reduce() - The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value..</li></ul>
</div>
<h2>have a go at explaining how recursion compares to iteration (In your own words)</h2>
  <ul><li>Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. Most loops can be rewritten in a recursive style, and in some functional languages this approach to looping is the default.</li></ul>
