      <p>Try the 'Just Like Me' and 'Loving Kindness' practices. How did you feel?</p>
        <ul><li>With the 'just like me' practice, it helped me to develop a sense of equality and shared life experiences with that other person.  It helped to me realise that my challenges are not that different to other people.  The loving kindness exercise was interesting in that I've never intentionally wished for kindness towards a particular person, although I prefer the first exercise more.</li></ul>
      <p>Try the 'Traditional Practice of Loving Kindness' - Did you prefer this technique?</p>
        <ul><li>No I didn't because a few minutes of repeating phrases to myself felt artificial and reheared, and I don't like the overall feel of this exercise for that reason. </li></ul>
      <p>Have you been in a situation in which Empathetic Listening could have improved a conversation? Or, describe a situation where empathetic listening practices worked well</p>
        <ul><li>I encountered many situations of empathetic listening, some of which I've been the one involved listening.  For example one person opened up to me about his personal issues with depression and struggles associated with it, and I could feel that it developed a deeper sense of trust between us and a better relationship overall.  I think this is a good techniaue as long as it's done with no personal agenda and is honest, and with good intention of the other person</ul></li>
      <p>Give an example of "person praise" and "process praise"</p>
           <ul><li>e.g. of 'person praise' would be like saying someone has done well in a maths test because they're naturally smart.  On the contrary an e.g. of 'process praise' would be saying you've done well in the maths test because you worked your butt off.  One is coming from a fixed mindset, whilst the other comes from a growth mindset.</li></ul>
