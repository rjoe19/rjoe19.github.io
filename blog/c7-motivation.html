            <h2>Q & A</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? happiness derived via pleasure isn't sustainble; once it's gone you go back to normal.  happiness from passion or flow is more sustainble.  Happiness derived from purpose is sustainble and should be prioritized over the others.
              </li>
              <li>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, 1) What are your core values? They would be creativity, autonomy, helping others, continual learning and mastery.  2) What do you stand for?  Living a life that's designed around freedom and autonomy, that's free from tight and rigid constraints and one that lives to continually improve and self develop.
              </li>
              <li>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?  Good in terms of realising the need for developing greater emotional and cognitive resilience, and inadequacies that I currently have and need to work on in my life.  The need to not internalise failure and let that be a stubling block towards future endeavours is powerful.
              </li>
