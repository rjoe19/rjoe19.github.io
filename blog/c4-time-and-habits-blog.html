          <h2>Time and Habits</h2>
          <div class = "skywalker"
            <ol>
              <li>which timebox and habits techniques did you try? The Pomodoro technique but instead of only 25 minutes, I've been having 50 minutes of work followed by 10 mins break.</li>
              <li>what did you find interesting?  The power of meditation.  Usually we don't think that this practise can relate to time management.  In fact when we clear our minds and get rid of the mental clutter that builds up, we enable ourselves to become more effective throughout the day doing our tasks.</li>
              <li>what worked for you? The pomadoro technique.  It's so easy to think you can power through a three hours block, but that ends up fatiguing you, so it's important to take a break at regular intervals.  This also aids in memory recall abiity.</li>
              <li>which will you experiment further with? Definitely explore meditation more as the benefits from it are too numerous to ignore.  I will also explore developing good habits and getting rid of bad ones.</li>
