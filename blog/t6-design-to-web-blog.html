    <h2>Questions....</h2>
      <p>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</p>
        <ul><li>- Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices (from desktop computer monitors to mobile phones.

	-Importance: Responsive web design is becoming more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. This trend is so prevalent that Google has begun to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device. This has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly.</li></ul>
      <p>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</p>
        <ul><li>- mobile first means designing an online experience for mobile before designing it for the desktop Web

	- importance: Mobile first shifts the paradigm of a Web-site user experience. Instead of users’ viewing desktop versions of Web sites on their mobile device with some adjustments, users are now viewing sites that have been created specifically for their mobile device - this improves the user experience, making it more enjoyable and accessible.</li></ul>
      <p>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</p>
        <ul><li>- CSS frameworks are pre-prepared software frameworks that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid.


	<li>Pros: - They provide code that you just don't need to write from scratch every time
	- They relieve cross-browser concerns.
	- They can help you learn CSS.
	</li>


	<li>Cons: - Bloated: There may be CSS styles set up in a framework to accommodate tons of different layouts that you'll never use. If you are concerned about every byte of a web page, you are going to end up doing a lot of stripping away of usused code, which ruins the point of the framework.
	-In order to really benefit, and actually save time, you'll need to use one framework over and over.
	-It changes the way you write your HTML. ie. having to use predetermined names for classes/ids
	</li>

      <p>What a wireframe is and why we use it</p>
           <ul><li>- A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website
	-Why we use it: It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information</li></ul>
     <p> The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</p>
           <ul><li>-- I found implementing the hamburger menu difficult as I had to integrate javascript along with the relevant css and html.  This was quite fiddly.
	</li></ul>
     <p> The accessibility features you included in your site</p>
           <ul><li>-- alternative text for web images.
	- Making it mobile first, i.e. hamburger menu that hides page links, collapsable grid pattern (single column for mobile)
	- using skeleton css framework which is compatible with all major browsers.
	</li></ul>
     <p> The usability features you included in your site:</p>
           <ul><li>usability means user centered design:
- Mobile responsiveness –  Make sure your site can handle different screen sizes , using the skeleton framework as well as implementing hamburger menu that's mobile first.
- Clarity: keeping the website simple and designed to help the users goals re why they're there and helping them navigate around it easily.
	</li></ul>
