    <h2>It's been a long eight sprints</h2>
        <p> Which concepts did you find most difficult?</p>
        <ul><li>I would say out of HTML, CSS and Javascript, I would definitely say Javascript was by far the hardest.  Specifically I struggle with the concepts of 'this' , callback functions, recursions and other nitty gritty things in JS that concept-wise are understandable but when it comes to actually implementing them in code are difficult.  </li></ul>
        <p> Which skills/concepts do you feel still confused by? (Don't worry, we don't expect you to have mastered everything!)'</p>
        <ul><li>As mentioned above,'this' , callback functions, recursions and other nitty gritty things in JS ...I also would like to master jquery much better, I can do basic things and am kinda getting the hang of it but again more confidence with it, learn more methods and how to be more proficient overall. </li></ul>
        <p> Which skills/concepts do you feel you understand best?</p>
        <ul><li>Basic HTML, CSS I am ok with although I must admit I dont' naturally have much patience with fiddling with CSS, but am slowly developing that!  I feel I have a grasp of the general basics of JS - i.e. conditionals, functions, objects, arrays etc, and it's just a matter of time where I can feel more confident tying them all together within a whole program</ul></li>
          <p>Which aspects of web development so far do you enjoy the most?</p>
           <ul><li>I enjoy playing around with and testing a simple program, because I feel that ties everything up and gives what we learn context and meaning, instead of just learning HTML, CSS and JS in isolation within a sandboxed environment.  I'm a creative person and so feel I can express myself by doing that.</li></ul>
          <p>With an example, explain the differences between 'functional' and 'object oriented' programming</p>
           <ul>
              <li> Differences between functional and objected oriented programming can be summed up as follows:In object oriented programming everything (or almost everything) is treated as an object that can be modified and that can perform tasks, or in OOP speak one might say objects have state and behavior. What it buys you (among other more advanced things) is: modularity,and data hiding.</li>         
              <li>Here is an example: You might have an object that models a ball, from above the ball can be modified (i.e. you can change its state) for example you may be able to change the color of the ball. It can also perform tasks (i.e. it also has behavior) for example the ball can roll, or be thrown. As an object it is bundled neatly in a package that provides methods to change the state of the ball, and to make the ball perform actions. This package is usually called a module, in addition to the methods used to change state, and perform actions, the module also has data that is used to store any state information needed.
              </li>
              <li>Because this module is a complete package that models your object competely, the module can easily be reused in many different applications. Once it is wirtten and working anyone should be able to use the module without fully understanding internals. For example all one needs to know is that they want a red ball to throw. :)
               </li>
               <li>In functional programming what you have basically are a set of functions each of which performs a task. Selectively executing these function results in the solution to the problem at hand.  For example you might have a function that takes the coords. of a square computes the area, and you may have another function that computes the area of a triangle. By executing the square function 6 times you could compute the area of a cube. Or by executing a combination of the square and triangle functions you could compute the area of a rhomboid. As you can see you can build quite complex systems
                based on simple functions. 
                <li>Technically choosing OOP of FOP (or vice versa) you can always accomplish the same results in either paradigm, however what may be very easy to do with an OOP approach may prove to be very difficult in FOP, and the converse may also be true depending on the problem.
              </li>
            </ul>
