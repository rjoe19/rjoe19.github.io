          <h2>Dev Bootcamp</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience? For me the pedagogical framework is a breath of fresh air.  As I've already been through the university system and found it to be an old and stale and out-moded method of learning, I think EDA is a great step forward.  It's far more practical, teaching industry required employment skills, student centered and the iteration process on course design is so rapid, which you wouldn't experience at uni.
            </li>
            <li>What are your impressions? Great, fantastic.  Because of the point above, I'm super motivated and make the effort to come onsite at EDA to be immersed in a positive, relaxed environment.
            </li>
            <li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? By getting involved on the IM slack, but also meeting fellow students, teachers and staff at EDA
            </li>
            <li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?  Like what Shereef said in the video, people can come in with a restaurant mentality, i.e that of a consumer and just expect everything to be given to them because they've paid a lot of money.  I'm realising how much better it is to take on the 'kitchen' attitude, i.e. that things aren't going to be polished, that people will have issues and need help, that the staff, tutors and course content/delivery isn't perfect, but that I can help contribute towards making things better.  I think that would enhance my experience here and develop much more as a person.
            </li>
            <li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?  Yes, super excited, in particular to participate in the Bootcamp as I'll be able to put all I've learnt in phase-zero into a team environment.  I'm not nervous at the moment, but may be closer to that time.
            </li>
