      <p>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</p>
        <ul><li>-JavaScript is the scripting language that you use to add behaviour to your web pages â€” it can be used to validate the data you enter into a form (tell you if it is in the right format or not), provide drag and drop functionality, change styles on the fly, animate page elements such as menus, handle button functionality, and a million other things.   HTML on the otherhand is the content of the website, using tags to make it.  CSS adds style to the webpage.</li></ul>
      <p>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</p>
        <ul><li>control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated..  A loop is In computer programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. For Example 'waking up', would involve repeatable several steps i.e. 1) alarm goes off 2) wake up 3) shower 4)brush teeth 5) breakfast 6) end loop by leaving door to go to work </li></ul>
      <p>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</p>
        <ul><li></ul></li>
      <p>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</p>
           <ul><li>-Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions.</li></ul>
      <p>With an example, explain the differences between 'functional' and 'object oriented' programming</p>
           <ul><li>object orientated programming, is an attempt to structure imperative code. It makes models of the various concepts in the problem area and applies them. These models ("objects") are given functionality ("methods") that allow them to perform various actions, and each object can also hold information. The fundamental unit in OOP is the object, which can itself contain further objects, a bit like a Russian Matryoshka doll. The idea is to make it easier for human programmers to visualize the program by tying the program to concrete things, which lets you group things logically.  </li></ul>
            <ul><li>Functional programming treats the problem area as a chain of equations ("functions") which are strung together, a progression of definitions which lead to the answer. The information begins as a number of axioms and culminates in the answer (think of it as a logical argument that ends in what you see on the screen). Functional programming borrows many concepts from formal mathematics, and as in mathematics (and unlike Imperative programming or OOP), it usually does not save data between steps. The fundamental unit in functional programming is the function, which can perform operations as well as produce further functions.</li></ul>
