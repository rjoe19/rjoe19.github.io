    <h2>Question and Answer Time</h2>
      <p>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?
      <ul>
         <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and forms the basic building blocks of the webpage.  An analogy I would use is the overall structure of a building, the walls, floor, but not the interior design or the style of the site. </li>  
         <li>CSS stands for Cascading StyleSheets and controls the look of how webpages appear in the browser.  An analogy would be the interior design, colour, and overall style of a building.  Without CSS the building would look drab and boring.  CSS helps bring a webpage to life.  </li>
         <li>DOM is the Document Object Model.  It's a structured repreentation of a document and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content.  Often Used with Javascript.  An analogy would be a tree whereby you can add new branches, cut off old branches, grow new branches, trim the leaves or add new ones. You can also modify the whole tree by changing the trunk (window) object.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What is meant by boxifying design?</p>
       <ul><li>Basically its when you draw boxes around all the relevant elements on a mockup webpage in order for you to structure how you're going to design the webpage systematically to an HTML document.</li></ul>
       <p>What is the box model?</p>
      <ul><li> Each element in a document is representated by a rectangular box.  The CSS box model describes the content of the space taken by each element, comprised from inner to outer: content, padding, border, and margin.  These can each be manipulated to change the look of the spacing within each element.
