            <h2>Q & A</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>How did the trigger training exercises feel? Good, I particularly found the Siberian North Railroad method of dealing with triggers to be quite effective, practical. I'm yet to actually do this in real life, but I can see the benefits of using especially during triggers that make me feel angry or anxious.
              </li>
              <li>Did you notice any responses in yourself? Haven't yet had a chance to use the properties yet, but I have in the past stopped and taken a few heavy breathes before when some emotional trigger came in (usually anger), and this helped to centre myself and calm myself down before I made a reaction.  
              </li>
              <li>What emotion do you want to befriend? Anger, and I think hopefully by befriending it, I won't allow it to be my master.
              </li>
