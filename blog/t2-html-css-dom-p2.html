    <h2>Question and Answer Time</h2>
      <p>What is grid based design?
        <ul><li>A system comprised of horizontal and vertical lines which intersect and arrange content. In even more basic terms (which make it easier to understand!) a grid system is a way of providing a system that designers can work with to structure and present content and imagery in a much more readable, manageable way.  It helps to provide consistency in your designs.</li></ul>
      <p>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</p>
        <ul><li>Because of the rapid adoption of smartphone and tablets requires a web design thats appropriate for those specific mediums. Of important consideration is Google search ranking preference for mobile friendly websites, better user experience across many devices.  Also it's easier to manage a website that is mobile responsive, as opposed to having a separate desktop and mobile website to maintain (as well as separate SEO campaign strategies if they're being implemented)</li></ul>
      <p>Semantic Structure</p>
        <ul><li>In regards to HTML, this is essentially about reinforcing structural meaning, i.e. using tags, class names, and ids that reinforce the meaning of the content within the tags.  It's about using tags in the right way, so e.g. when using an ordered list vs an ordered one, the distinction is clear.  Remember that it's about structure and meaning.  Regarding how we present that structure and meaning, that's referring to CSS and we keep those separate (google separation of concerns)</li></ul>
      <p>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</p>
           <ul><li>I think it's important to learn to play around with HTML/CSS as much as you can.  Go to other websites, see what elements you found cool and feel free to copy and paste this into your code.  As the saying go good artists copy, great artists steal.  Do not be afraid of making 'mistakes', it's all part of the learning process and you can easily reverse things.  I think having an open attitude of learning and patience and persistence is important for learning making webpages, particularly with CSS since there's so many ways you can use style elements</li></ul>
