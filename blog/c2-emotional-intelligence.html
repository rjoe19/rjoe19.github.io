    <h2>Search Inside Yourself - Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>Did you connect with any of the analogies for the mind?</p>
        <ul><li>yes, the analogy of emotions being like a flag fluttering in the wind and mindfulness being like the flagpole, keeping the emotions centered was a good analogy for how we can maintain a third person perspective of ourselves and how to control our emotions and not fall victim to becoming them</li></ul>  
      <p>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</p>
         <ul><li>That we can view ourselves from a third person perspective, and seperate ourselves from our emotions.  By doing so we can allow ourselves to not become entangled in the flag fluttering changing state of emotions and get ourselves out of control.  We can remain centered like the flag pole.  The breakdown of the three emotional components of self-awareness was insightful, i.e. emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment, and self confidence helped to explain it well.  I guess for me, these three components come down to the saying 'know thyself', and in searching for that we can become better ppl of society.</li></ul>
      <p>How did you find the body scanning?</p>
        <ul><li>It was good, although I kind of rushed it, but I get the gist behind it.  Wouldn't say it 'changed me' after one session, but I can see how it enhances my mindfulness and in some ways it was a kind of meditation, and in doing so helped me to remove myself from my emotions and have a more third person perspective on myself.  Think I'll try to implement for health and wellbeing purposes, inc. my use of headspace app </li></ul>
